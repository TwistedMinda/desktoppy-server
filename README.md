## Introduction

Welcome to our AI project's safe zone! This is a repository for storing and sharing code related to artificial intelligence.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

First create a virtual env (_and activate it_) and install dependencies in it.

```sh
$ python3 -m venv myenv
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Almost done!
We'll now need our local model (LLama3 by default but feel free to change)

[Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)

Test your installation by installing the model of your choice

```sh
$ ollama pull llama3
```

## Launch

Once you have everything installed, you're ready to start exploring the world of AI! Simply run the main script or application and follow the prompts to begin.

```
python3 main.py "Create a fancy file with a fancy name, code is allowed!"
```
