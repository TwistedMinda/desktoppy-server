
Prompt: - create a script that transforms all files from a directory using a text-to-speech library
- create a "requirements.txt" file that will include all python libraries required for the script to run
Mission: Here is the breakdown plan for the mission:

1. Create a new file named "transform_script.py" in C:/Users/Julien/projects/ai/safe_zone/
2. Copy the content from an existing file (e.g., "template_script.py") into the newly created "transform_script.py"
3. Rename the existing file to something like "old_template_script.py"
4. Create a new file named "requirements.txt" in C:/Users/Julien/projects/ai/safe_zone/
5. Write the text "pyttsx3" (or any other required Python library) into the newly created "requirements.txt"
